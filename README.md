Overview
---

In this project the goal is to perform semantic segmentation and to label pixels of road images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) based on the VGG-16 image classifier architecture.

Prerequisites and Executing
---

This project was built with python and requires the following dependencies:

 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

##### Dataset
For this project I used the [Kitti Road dataset](http://kitti.is.tue.mpg.de/kitti/data_road.zip) for training and testing. To use it you can extract the dataset in the `data` folder, this will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
